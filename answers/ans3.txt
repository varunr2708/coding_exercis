Problem 3 - Data Analysis
-------------------------
For every year, for every weather station, calculate:

* Average maximum temperature (in degrees Celsius)
* Average minimum temperature (in degrees Celsius)
* Total accumulated precipitation (in centimeters)

Ignore missing data when calculating these statistics.

Design a new data model to store the results. Use NULL for statistics that cannot be calculated.

Your answer should include the new model definition as well as the code used to calculate the new values and store them in the database.
